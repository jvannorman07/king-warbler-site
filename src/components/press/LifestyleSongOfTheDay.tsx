      If you’ve been keeping tally of unique local releases just over the past month, you already
      know 2024’s shaping up to be a big year. And King Warbler is definitely among that elite
      subset of Austin specimens who always perk our ears up within the first couple notes of their
      distinct calls.
      <br />
      With chief songwriter/vocalist/piano-keyboardist Jack Van Norman ever steering the formation
      forward, the five-player flock recently took another interesting turn in the long migration
      from 2016’s Rosanky. A half decade removed from the distortion-heavy 2018 EP Wake Up Blonde,
      King Warbler’s maintains that elevated production level on their upcoming sophomore
      full-length, Texas Sky, albeit with an extra element of ’70s sass showing up to the party.
      <br />
      Texas Sky touches down this Friday, followed by an LP release show 9:30PM this Saturday at
      Captain Quackenbush’s Soundscape alongside Abram Shook at 8:30 and Batty Jr. at 10:30. And
      based on the pair of lead singles that got shared a couple weeks back, Texas Sky is looking
      like a horizon-filling collection of sounds. Such as the blue-eyed “Lifestyle”, which circles
      the docks of early yacht rock on feathers of Allen Toussaint and Elton John with a little
      crest of Leon Russell on top. With a drum shuffle we think Bernard Purdie’d approve of,
      jazz-adjacent piano chords that give off Steely feels, beautifully-busy, scale-spanning bass
      licks, some tasteful electric guitar soaring past every once in a while, and impressive vocal
      intervals to boot, “Lifestyle” is a graceful, mature, and warmly-welcomed addition to Love
      Austin Music Month.
