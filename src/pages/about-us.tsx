    King Warbler formed in 2017 with their debut album Rosanky, named after songwriter Jack Van
    Normanâ€™s childhood hometown in east Texas. In the years since, they have been performing in
    Austin and touring, playing a mix of wryly upbeat rock anthems and sincerely plaintive ballads.
    Songs that hold close the ecstatic opposition of joyous tragedy and tragic joy.
    <br />
    <br />
    On January 27th, King Warbler released their second full-length record, Texas Sky, at Captain
    Quackenbush in Austin. Recorded in a dog-filled home in rural Dripping Springs, the songs
    explore the mirrors of love, divorce, friendship, and aging.
